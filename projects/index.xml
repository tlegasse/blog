&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s 3AM. You need a URL shortener fast. Your boss is breathing down your neck and you have no idea what to do. My new URL shortener is &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> what you need. Okay, kidding aside, this thing isn&amp;rsquo;t geared toward production environments with high throughput or anything like that. Instead, the goal was to showcase skills that I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up over the past several months in my learning journey with Go. It&amp;rsquo;s been really fun, and this project fit the bill of &amp;ldquo;complex enough to be interesting, not so complex that you program yourself into a hole&amp;rdquo;. The latter will come shortly, but for now I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased with how everything&amp;rsquo;s come out.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
