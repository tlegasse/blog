&lt;p&gt;This is the first of many planned articles on the topic of demoscene programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demos are self contained artistic presentations that are sometimes punctuated by extremely efficient and small code.
 Demoscene developers were typically restricted to extremely limited hardware and storage mediums. While this is
 hardly the case today, I find it prudent to still approach experimentation and learning with this in mind,
 especially when your average, basic node project contains thousands of packages. Yes, I'm a hater, but there's
 something special there.&lt;br&gt; Join me as I explore the core concepts of demoscene development from the context of a
 modern developer interested in learning what it means to get back to basics and develop such incredible works.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Go URL Shortener</title><link>https://www.tannerlegasse.com/projects/go-url-shortener/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.tannerlegasse.com/projects/go-url-shortener/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 3AM. You need a URL shortener fast. Your boss is breathing down your neck and you have no idea what to do. My new URL shortener is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what you need. Okay, kidding aside, this thing isn&amp;rsquo;t geared toward production environments with high throughput or anything like that. Instead, the goal was to showcase skills that I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up over the past several months in my learning journey with Go. It&amp;rsquo;s been really fun, and this project fit the bill of &amp;ldquo;complex enough to be interesting, not so complex that you program yourself into a hole&amp;rdquo;. The latter will come shortly, but for now I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased with how everything&amp;rsquo;s come out.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
