&lt;p>Powder toy (also known as a falling sand game), for those not familiar, is an sandbox like simulation game where the user is generally free to experiment with various materials which can interact together or sometimes on their own. Some of the game-play mechanics have found their way into public consciousness through games like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noita_%28video_game%29">Noita&lt;/a>, a popular rogue-like game with realistic material interactions.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s 3AM. You need a URL shortener fast. Your boss is breathing down your neck and you have no idea what to do. My new URL shortener is &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> what you need. Okay, kidding aside, this thing isn&amp;rsquo;t geared toward production environments with high throughput or anything like that. Instead, the goal was to showcase skills that I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up over the past several months in my learning journey with Go. It&amp;rsquo;s been really fun, and this project fit the bill of &amp;ldquo;complex enough to be interesting, not so complex that you program yourself into a hole&amp;rdquo;. The latter will come shortly, but for now I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased with how everything&amp;rsquo;s come out.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
