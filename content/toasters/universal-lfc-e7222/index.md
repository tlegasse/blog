This is a decidedly beautiful and opulent single slice toaster. Its latching mechanism is particularly frustrating and finicky.
It has a timer circuit, providing an automated means of cooking your bread. Assuming that the newspaper clipping is from when it was new in 1930, and adjusting for inflation to the time of this writing, this toaster was worth roughly $338 in today's money ðŸ˜®
