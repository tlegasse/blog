This was the first consumer available electric toaster. Many of the original were equippde with a cord bearing an edison (light bulb) socket style plug. As such, the story of the electric toaster in the early days reflects an America experiencing rapid electrification. Electricity in the home was initially only perceived as a means of replacing the lamp.
