This wonderful toaster represents the first turnover toaster. That is, a toaster with doors on the side bearing fingers on the bottom that simultaneously hold the toast up, and flip it over when you draw the doors down. This design was patented by David Copeman, but it's rumored that his wife invented the design, inspired by earrings she saw in a shop window. Quite a fun story when you think about it, I wish she got the credit if she invented it, but it informed the next 6 or so years of toasters. Patent was in 1914.
