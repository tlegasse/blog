The Cadillac of toasters. This toaster is reliable and robust. It also has only one moving control; darkness. The action of placing the bread in the top activates an electromagnet controlling the pulling in of the bread. A bimetalic strip controls the conclusion of cooking and the toast is pushed back up through the top. This toaster is fully automatic and is extremely nice to use. I recommend it for any collector.
