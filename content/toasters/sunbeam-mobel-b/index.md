This. This is my favorite toaster of all time from the perspective of function. It's so good I have 2. It features a cage that flips in a radial manner, making turning the toast easy without burning your fingers. You can also pull the toast away from the element to remove it. It toasts phenominally well, using the rising properties of heat to cook the bread.
