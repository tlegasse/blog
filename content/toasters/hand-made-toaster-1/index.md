First, the pinching arms are bent at 90 degree angles, the creator intended on the springs to perch on the bent portion. The springs also differ from side to side. Perhaps one or both of the original springs had fallen off, which seems very likely. The cord also attaches directly to the heating element wire coming from between two incredibly thick layers of asbestos. It's also possible to note that the rivets keeping the corner pieces affixed did not include space for any kind of soft rubber feet, which would be likely if assembled in a factory." >}}

There are SO many things I love about toasters, but my absolute favorite is that occasionally you'll come across specimens that were made in small volumes, like the [Glorette](/toasters/glorette/), but very seldome can one point to an entire hand made specimen!


This toaster was either a very rough, inexact unit straight from the manufacturer, and was hobbled along by the owner in ways I'll outline below, or this toaster was made by hand.


Here's a few ways I see evidence of hand-made elements:
- The asbestos heating element was hand-crafted, with pencil markings running down one side to mart the holes.
- The electric cord is rather new, being made from a plastic insulated cord, and rather crudely connected under the base.
- The springs pulling shut the crude wire pinchers differ from one side to the other.


There are also a few reasons I suspect the body to be hand made, like the fact that basically every dimension is unsymetrical and off by just a hair.


Regardless of its true origin, this toaster was either made with love, or limped through time with love, and this makes me very happy. Its crude appearance is but a distinguishing feature, and is not a drawback, and my time as its steward will be marked by a deep appreciation.
