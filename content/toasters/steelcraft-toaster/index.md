I have a lot of love for this toaster. It is true to say that it's sparse. It's true to say that it may be the actual least that an object can be to be considered a toaster, but there's something specail about this one. It reminds me of the American Arts and Crafts movement, or something you'd see in a farmhouse.
They have appeared in different colors. Some of them have bright red feet, but polished wire.
