Some toasters are overrated. This may be one of them. It is unlike any other, I'll give it that, it has a conveyor belt that moves the bread past coiled heating elements. It works medium well, and is very mechanically complex. Overall, I'd give it a "great innovation, but lacking" out of 10. It's cool as hell though.
