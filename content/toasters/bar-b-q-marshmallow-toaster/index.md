One of the things I love most about toasters is the occasional frivolity of it all. A toaster that toasts marshmallows... I mean WHY NOT?!
The Angelus company was also responsible for creating [Cracker Jack](https://www.campfiremarshmallows.com/campfire-history/). It seems that they have a knack for delight. This toaster was specifically meant as a [promotional tool for their marshmallows](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_704103).
