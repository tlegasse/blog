This is the first consumer-available popup toasters. Toastmaster (Charles Strite) had produced commercially available toasters to restaurants as early as 1919, but miniaturization would prove illusive until the mighty 1A1. The timing mechanism would remain quite similar throughout the toastmaster lineage.
