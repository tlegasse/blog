<p>Sin and cosin express the phase of a sin wave either in forward or backwards direction respectively.</p>
<p>As such, sin and cosin produce a number between -1 and 1 given an input angle.</p>
<p>They're used heavily across animations to produce repeating angular values:</p>
<pre class="code">
    const pX = Math.cos(timestamp / timeCoefficient) * rad
    const pY = Math.sin(timestamp / timeCoefficient) * rad
</pre>

<p>Combinations therein can create cool affects, such as this one where the output "particle" follows in a radial
    fashion around a point on our circle.</p>
<p>In the example here, the naked point on our circle is represented by the blue dot.</p>
<p>Our particle is represented by the orange dot, which is added as an offset to the blue dot's coordinates. Note
    that it's circling the blue dot 8 times per rotation of the larger circle at half the larger circle's radius.
</p>
<pre class="code">
    const particlePX = Math.cos(timestamp / timeCoefficient * 8) * (rad / 2)
    const particlePY = Math.sin(timestamp / timeCoefficient * 8) * (rad / 2)
</pre>

<p>When combined with text, sin can easily create a bouncing letter effect:</p>

<p>And with some color and size function?!</p>
