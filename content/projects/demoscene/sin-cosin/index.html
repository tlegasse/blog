<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This is the first of many planned articles on the topic of demoscene programming.</p>
<p>Demos are self contained artistic presentations that are sometimes punctuated by extremely efficient and small code.
    Demoscene developers were typically restricted to extremely limited hardware and storage mediums. While this is
    hardly the case today, I find it prudent to still approach experimentation and learning with this in mind,
    especially when your average, basic node project contains thousands of packages. Yes, I'm a hater, but there's
    something special there.<br> Join me as I explore the core concepts of demoscene development from the context of a
    modern developer interested in learning what it means to get back to basics and develop such incredible works.</p>

<p>I just want to highlight: demos were mind-blowing, and the computers they were made on/for could essentially trade
    blows with an NES, and were just barely 1980's technology. Check out the video here for examples.</p>

<h2>Enough talk</h2>
<p>A sinusoidal (sin) wave is what you get plot the 360Â° circumference of a circle as distance from the resting
    plane over time.</p>
<p>Sine and cosine functions relate to the expression of the phase of a sine wave either in forward or backwards
    direction
    respectively.</p>
<p>As such, sine and cosine functions (as we enjoy them from math libraries) produce a number between -1 and 1 given an
    input angle.</p>
<p>They're used heavily across animations to produce repeating angular values. Take this example of a ball following the
    circumference of a circle:</p>
<pre class="code">
    const pX = Math.cos(timestamp / timeCoefficient) * rad
    const pY = Math.sin(timestamp / timeCoefficient) * rad
</pre>
<canvas id="c1"></canvas>

<br>

<hr>

<p>Combinations of different mathematical functions can create cool effects, such as this one where the output
    "particle" follows in a radial
    fashion around an orbiting point on our circle.</p>
<p>In the example here, the orbit on our primary circle is represented by the blue dot.</p>
<p>Our satellite is represented by the orange dot, which is added as an offset to the blue dot's coordinates. Note
    that it's circling the blue dot 8 times per rotation of the larger circle at half the larger circle's radius.
</p>
<pre class="code">
    const particlePX = Math.cos(timestamp / timeCoefficient * 8) * (rad / 2)
    const particlePY = Math.sin(timestamp / timeCoefficient * 8) * (rad / 2)
</pre>

<p>When combined with text, sine can easily create a bouncing letter effect:</p>
<pre>
    const vOffset = Math.sin((timestamp + (key * 360)) / timeCoefficient) * 25
</pre>
<canvas id="c3"></canvas>

<p>And with some color and size function?! It's actually a lot simpler than it appears. We're spoiled with easy HSL
    color functions that weren't present in the C64 days with which we can leverage browser native radial color
    calculation features.</p>
<pre>
    for (const key in inputStr) {
    const vOffset = Math.sin((timestamp + (key * 360)) / timeCoefficient) * 36

    ctx.font = `${32 + Math.cos((timestamp + (key * 360)) / timeCoefficient) * 16}px monospace`;
    ctx.fillStyle = `hsl(${Math.cos((timestamp + (key * 360)) / timeCoefficient) * 180} ,50%, 50%)`
    ctx.strokeStyle = ctx.fillStyle
    ctx.lineWidth = '8px'
    ctx.fillText(inputStr[key], key * 25 + 15, (canvasDims.height / 2) + vOffset);
    }
</pre>
<canvas id="c4"></canvas>


<h2>Thanks!</h2>
<p>That's it for sine and cosine. I'll be doing more of a deep dive no doubt in using these in more advanced ways, so
    please do join me next time :)</p>
