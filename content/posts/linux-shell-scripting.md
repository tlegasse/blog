# Linux Shell Scripting: Building Production-Ready Automation

## Introduction
- [ ] Problem statement: Manual processes in development workflows
- [ ] Why shell scripting remains relevant for backend systems
- [ ] Scope and target use cases

## Fundamentals Review
- [ ] Shell selection considerations (bash, zsh, dash)
- [ ] Script structure and shebang best practices
- [ ] Environment variables and parameter handling
- [ ] Exit codes and error handling patterns

## Core Scripting Patterns
- [ ] Variable scoping and quoting strategies
- [ ] Control flow constructs and when to use each
- [ ] Function design and reusability principles
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Output formatting and logging approaches

## Advanced Techniques
- [ ] Process management and job control
- [ ] Signal handling and cleanup procedures
- [ ] File descriptor manipulation
- [ ] Subshells vs command substitution trade-offs
- [ ] Performance considerations for large-scale operations

## Maintainability and Testing
- [ ] Code organization and modular design
- [ ] Documentation standards and inline comments
- [ ] Testing frameworks (bats, shunit2)
- [ ] Version control integration strategies
- [ ] Debugging techniques and common pitfalls

## Integration with Backend Systems
- [ ] Database interaction patterns
- [ ] API integration and JSON processing (jq)
- [ ] Log analysis and monitoring hooks
- [ ] Deployment automation considerations
- [ ] Container orchestration integration

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Input validation and injection prevention
- [ ] Credential management approaches
- [ ] File permission handling
- [ ] Audit trail implementation

## Performance and Optimization
- [ ] Benchmarking script execution
- [ ] Memory usage patterns
- [ ] Parallel processing strategies
- [ ] Resource cleanup and leak prevention

## Production Deployment
- [ ] Configuration management integration
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Rollback and recovery procedures
- [ ] Documentation and handoff processes

## Additional Learning
- [ ] Make proficiency for complex build automation
- [ ] systemd unit file creation for service management
- [ ] Ansible integration for infrastructure automation
- [ ] Git hooks implementation for workflow enforcement
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection from scripts
- [ ] POSIX compliance for cross-platform portability

## Conclusion
- [ ] Key takeaways for sustainable automation
- [ ] Next steps for continued skill development
- [ ] Resource recommendations for ongoing reference
