# Welcome!

I'm Tanner, a Sr. back end developer and sometimes freelancer. I've worked across tech stacks, and for clients of various industries, large and small, but these days I spend most of my time establishing and advancing retail companies' presence on the web with Shopify technologies.

I used to work a lot with WordPress, and did a ton of client work with PHP frameworks, but I found out that Shopify makes me really happy. It's not the only thing though. I love Linux systems and challenging myself to simplify my workflows and work more directly with the fundamental tools. And Vim... Definitely Vim. You'll see some of all of that right here.

I'm excited to share all about what I'm learning and working on. If you've ever felt overwhelmed by how incredibly handsome, well-informed and unbelievably infallible some people are on the internet... don't worry so much, you probably won't get that feeling here, I don't take myself so seriously üòÅ
